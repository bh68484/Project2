# Project 2 - FaceBark

#### FaceBark was created utilizing full-stack development techniques and technology. The purpose of FaceBark is to provide a way for dog lovers, like us, to not only find parks to take our dogs but also find new people to potentially socialize with. With FaceBark, a user can find a park and see who is at that park, including what dogs, in order to make a decision as to what park they're headed to for the day.

##### The contributors to FaceBark were: Max F., Jamie K., David T., Rich H. and Brandon H.
